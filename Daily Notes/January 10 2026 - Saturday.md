### Lore:

Went to Blue Tokai and spent the most of my time setting up obsidian. It was an enormous effort given that I also had to sync it to my iPhone and I decided to use git for it, which I had no idea could work.
Also the Chimichuri Croissant Sandwich was amazing.

Did not allow the Intercom guy to remove broadband, just to be petty.
