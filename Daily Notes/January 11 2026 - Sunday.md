### Lore

Talked to Amarnath, some notes:
- ESOPs do not work with startups as investors treat that as noise.
	- They would rather buy them out or ask the founder to buy them out.
	- The clean buy is always the best option.
	- Standing in front of the investor with all stakeholders gives more confidence.
- Founder traits become traits of the company, it is enchanted in the DNA.
	- This Includes Discipline, Structure and even how you dress up.
	- Follow well-defined procedures from the start.
- Investors bet on the person more than the business itself.
- Do not interrupt the thinking process of creative people, they get irritated fast.
- Meaningful connections are built even without the promise of immediate gain.
- Every word spoken by an experienced person is equivalent to 300-400 said by a newbie.
