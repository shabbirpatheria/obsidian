### Lore

Talked to Amarnath Uncle
- ESOPs do not work with startups as investors treat that as noise.
	- They would rather buy them out or ask the founder to buy them out.
- Founder traits become traits of the company, it is enchanted in the DNA.
- Do not interrupt the thinking process of creative people, they get irritated fast.
- Meaningful connections are built even without the promise of immediate gain
